Java Basic Notes: 

basic architecture. 
Java is not understandable by your computer. 
You need to use a Java development kit to translate your code into binary files. 
Classes also make up binary files alongside and entire .java file
THese binary files are then sent to the the Java virtual machine.
A Java virtual machine is a simulated computer for running java code. 
The advantages to this are you can run a JVM on any machine. 
For instance with C++ you will need to compile each file differently on different machines. 
The JVM is setup by you Java Run Time Environment. 
THis then outputs or runs your program.
